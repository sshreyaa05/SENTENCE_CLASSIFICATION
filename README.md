### Sentence Classification for Restaurant Reviews Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with Embedding Layer
### Overview:
This project classifies restaurant reviews as positive or negative using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with an embedding layer. Reviews are transformed into embeddings, capturing word meanings, and the ANN model is trained to predict the sentiment.

### Result:
The ANN model achieved an accuracy of 0.7 in classifying the restaurant reviews into positive or negative categories.

### Conclusion:
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of using embeddings in an ANN for sentiment analysis, achieving a 0.7 accuracy, showing the potential of this approach for text classification tasks.
